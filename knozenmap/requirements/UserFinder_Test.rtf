\f0\fs24 \cf0 You've been assigned the task of creating a map of where Knozen has been used by the last 7 active users.\
\
Please create an iOS application by implementing the following requirements:\
\
* Dynamically retrieve an XML file which contains a list of user locations and geo-coordinates from http://dev1.knowadozen.com/site_media/locations.xml\
* Display the locations using 2 screens: a list of locations and a map view. It should recognize how many address locations are in the given XML file and show them in a list. Tapping on a single address should then switch to the second screen and show the map view of the address.\
* Add a toggle to the list screen so the user can choose to see a table view of the locations or a map view. Persist this preference.\
\
Your code will be evaluated for style, simplicity and approach.}
